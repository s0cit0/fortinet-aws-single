# Terraform Deployment Scripts
## Introduction
This project includes a streamlined set of Terraform scripts for getting started on AWS with Fortinet. The repository now
focuses solely on the **single FortiGate topology**, which provisions one FortiGate-VM instance with the necessary
networking components for a basic deployment. The previous collection of high-availability and advanced topologies has been
removed to keep the scope intentionally minimal.

## Support
Fortinet-provided scripts in this and other GitHub projects do not fall under the regular Fortinet technical support scope and are not supported by FortiCare Support Services.

## Notes 
This project is based on the original work by [Fortinet](https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-terraform-deploy), which provided a broader solution.  
I have cloned and adapted it to meet specific requirements by removing unnecessary components and simplifying the deployment for my use case.
