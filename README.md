## Notes 
This project is based on the original work by [Fortinet](https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-terraform-deploy), which provided a broader solution.  
I have cloned and adapted it to meet specific requirements by removing unnecessary components and simplifying the deployment for my use case.
