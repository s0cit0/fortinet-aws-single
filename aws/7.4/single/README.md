# Deployment of a FortiGate-VM (BYOL/PAYG) on AWS
## Introduction
A Terraform configuration to deploy a FortiGate-VM on AWS with only the essential networking components.

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 1.0.0
* Terraform Provider AWS >= 5.0.0

## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - AWS VPC with 2 subnets
   - One FortiGate-VM instance with 2 NICs
   - Two Security Groups: one for external, one for internal traffic
   - Two Route tables: one for internal subnet and one for external subnet

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to AWS:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  Rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars` once updated.
3. Ensure your AWS credentials are available to Terraform (for example via environment variables or AWS profiles).
4. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd aws/7.4/single
   $ terraform init
    ```
5. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instance:
```sh
FGTPublicIP = <FGT Public IP>
Password = <FGT Password>
Username = <FGT Username>
```

After deployment, apply your FortiGate license and configuration manually using the exposed management interfaces.

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
